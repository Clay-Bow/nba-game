# 🏀 NBA Imposter Game

A simple mobile-friendly web game where players take turns looking at a hidden NBA player or team. Everyone sees the same name **except the imposters**, who receive a message telling them they are the imposter. After all players have viewed their card, the discussion begins — can the group identify the imposters?

This game is inspired by "Spyfall" and "Imposter"-style party games, but themed specifically for NBA fans.
